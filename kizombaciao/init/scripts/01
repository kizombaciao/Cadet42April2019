# Write a script which displays

#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1,3,6

# A UID (user identifier) is a number assigned 
# by Linux to each user on the system. 
# This number is used to identify 
# the user to the system 
# and to determine which system resources the user can access. 
# UIDs are stored in the /etc/passwd file: ... 
# Groups in Linux are defined by GIDs (group IDs).

# $cut -d "delimiter" -f (field number) file.txt
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cut-command-linux-examples/
# we use colon as delimiter in above case
# and extract field 1, 3, and 6.

# https://askubuntu.com/questions/141928/what-is-the-difference-between-bin-sh-and-bin-bash
# bash and sh are two different shells. 
# Basically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax.

# "#!" is an operator called shebang 
# which directs the script to the interpreter location. 
# So, if we use"#! /bin/sh" the script gets directed to the bourne-shell.
