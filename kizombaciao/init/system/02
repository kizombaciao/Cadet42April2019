sudo hostname new_hostname

# to see the current hostname:
# hostname

# A host name is a name that is assigned to a host 
# (i.e., a computer connected to the network) 
# that uniquely identifies it on a network 
# and thus allows it to be addressed 
# without using its full IP address. 
# Domain names are user-friendly substitutes 
# for numeric IP addresses.

# hostname command in Linux 
# is used to obtain the DNS(Domain Name System) name 
# and set the systemâ€™s hostname 
# or NIS(Network Information System) domain name.
