# Are the returned IP addresses similiar?

The question is a bit ambiguous.

If comparing 06 vs 07:
No, because one is for the IP address of slash16.org
and the other is address of the DNS server.

If comparing the multiple IP addresses returned for slash16.org:
They do look similar, except for the last sequence.
