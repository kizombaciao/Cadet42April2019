# Identify the MAC address of the Wi-Fi card

ifconfig en1 | awk '/ether/{print $2}'

# 28:f0:76:3e:ef:82

# It searches one or more files to see 
# if they contain lines that matches 
# with the specified patterns 
# and then performs the associated actions.

# First, your computer doesn't have a MAC address. 
# Your network card has a MAC address. 
# So if you have a wireless card 
# and an Ethernet card, you'll have two MAC addresses.
# ifconfig | grep ether

# how do we know en1 is the wifi card ???

# By default, 
# en0 and en1 are your physical network connections 
# (wired and wireless LAN). 
# lo0 is the loopback interface. 
# fw0 is the IP over Firewire interface.
# vmnet interfaces are installed by VMware 
# for network communication with virtual machines.

# On systems with both an ethernet and wireless connection, 
# en0 will be your ethernet interface 
# and en1 will be your wireless interface. 
# A MAC address will be shown 
# for both en0 and en1 and likely labelled as "ether".

# On systems with just a wireless connection, 
# en0 will be your wireless interface. 
# The MAC address for en0 will likely be labelled as "ether".

# on apple computers, sysinfo>network>wifi>interfaces>MAC address
