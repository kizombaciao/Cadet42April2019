# Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device, 
# usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer 
# (or group of computers) inside a private network. 
# The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses 
# an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes.

# BASICALLY, THE SAME AS FINDING THE DEFAULT GATEWAY !!!
