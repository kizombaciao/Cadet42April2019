# shows how a data transmission travelled 
# from a local machine to a remote one.
# A typical example would be loading a web page. 
# Loading a web page over the internet 
# involves data flowing through a network 
# and a number of routers. 
# The traceroute command can show the route taken 
# and the IP and hostnames of routers on the network. 
# It can be useful for understanding latency 
# or diagnosing network issues.
