# netstat's '-n' flag shows network addresses as numbers. 
# When this flag is not specified, 
# the netstat command interprets addresses 
# where possible and displays them symbolically. 
# This flag can be used with any of the display formats.

# netstat's '-r' flag shows the routing tables. 
# When used with the -s flag, the-r flag shows routing statistics. 

# 'head -1' will show first line from piped input.

# network statistics
# shows very detailed info on how your computer is communicating 
# with other computers or network devices.
# which ports and addresses the corresponding connections 
# (TCP, UDP) are running 
# and which ports are open for tasks.
