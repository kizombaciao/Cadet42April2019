TCP VS UDP:
> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-MldfyhIuo
> UDP is used for streaming
since you don't need a handshake to confirm
that all packages have been received.
unlike TCP.

HOW NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION WORK:

DHCP:
> Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
> purpose is to assign unique IP addresses to our hosts
> also, provides network addresses for subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS address

ETHERNET:
> LAN - local area network
> wired system
> IEEE 802.3 standard

home router:
> is connected to the ISP.

INIT:
> The fundamental purpose of an init system 
is to initialize the components 
that must be started after the Linux kernel is booted 
(traditionally known as “userland” components). 
The init system is also used to manage services 
and daemons for the server at any point 
while the system is running.

ip v4 vs ip v6:
> the latter has many more addresses than the mere 4 billion with ip v4
> ip v6 eliminates the need for router to disseminate packets within private network.

NAT forwarding table:
> Network Address Translation
> tells you whether the return packet from webserver goes to laptop or tablet.
> single point of failure

NETSTAT:
Netstat — derived from the words network and statistics 
— is a program that's controlled via commands 
issued in the command line. 
It delivers basic statistics on all network activities 
and informs users on which ports and addresses 
the corresponding connections (TCP, UDP) are running 
and which ports are open for tasks.

OSI Model
The OSI Model consist of several layers.
Layer 1 - Physical (Lowest-level)
Layer 2 - Data Link
Layer 3 - Network
Layer 4 - Transport
Layer 5 - Session
Layer 6 - Presentation
Layer 7 - Application Layer (Highest-level)

port 80:
> frequently, used for http traffic

private networks:
> 192.168.x.x
> 10.x.x.x

private vs public address:

PUBLIC IP ADDRESS:
> what the world sees as your address

ROOT:
> On every Linux system, 
the root account is a special user 
that has administrative rights.

ROUTING TABLE:
> A routing table is a set of rules, 
often viewed in table format, 
that is used to determine 
where data packets traveling 
over an Internet Protocol (IP) network will be directed. 
All IP-enabled devices, including routers and switches, 
use routing tables.

# for emails

SSID:
> wireless network name
> Service Set Identifier
