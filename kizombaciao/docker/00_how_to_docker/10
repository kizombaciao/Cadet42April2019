docker volume create hatchery

# Create a volume named hatchery.

# -------------------------

# // Volumes are the preferred mechanism 
# for persisting data generated by 
# and used by Docker containers. 
# While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure 
# of the host machine, 
# volumes are completely managed by Docker. 

# > docker volume ls
# > docker volume inspect hatchery
# > docker volume rm hatchery
