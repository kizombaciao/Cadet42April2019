docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name overlord --restart always nginx

# Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, 
# as a background task. 
# It should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, 
# and have its 80 port attached to the 5000 port of Char. 
# You can check that your container functions properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser.

# Docker is the command-line tool 
# that uses containerization to manage multiple images 
# and containers and volumes and such 
# -- a container is basically a lightweight virtual machine.

# HOW DO WE KNOW THE MACHINE PORT NUMBER IS 5000 ???

# WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO RESTART ON ITS OWN ?
# Always restart the container regardless of the exit status. 
# When you specify always, 
# the Docker daemon will try to restart the container indefinitely. 
# The container will also always start on daemon startup, 
# regardless of the current state of the container.
