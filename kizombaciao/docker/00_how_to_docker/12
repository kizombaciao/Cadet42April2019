# Launch a mysql container as a background task. 
# It should be able to restart on its own in case of error, 
# and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan. 
# You will also make sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, 
# that the container directly creates a database named zerglings, 
# and that the container itself is named spawning-pool.
