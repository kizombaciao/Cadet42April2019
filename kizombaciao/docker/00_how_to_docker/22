docker-machine ssh Aiur \
    "docker swarm join --token $(docker swarm join-token worker -q) $(docker-machine ip Char):2377"

# Turn Aiur into a slave of the local swarm in which Char is leader 
# (the command to take control of Aiur is not requested).

# -------------------------
# docker swarm join-token worker -q

# you can ssh into the worker to run docker swarm join
# or run the Aiur (worker) vm, and run the docker swarm join directly.
# but i tried the latter and it did not work.

# how do you find the port number 2377 ?
# docker-machine env Char

# > echo $(docker swarm join-token worker -q)

# > docker swarm leave // for worker
# > docker swarm leave --force // in case, of master

# NOT NEEDED:
# eval $(docker-machine env Aiur)
# docker swarm join --token $(docker swarm join-token -q) $(docker-machine ip Char):2377
# echo $(cat ~/.worker_token)
# this file was created earlier
