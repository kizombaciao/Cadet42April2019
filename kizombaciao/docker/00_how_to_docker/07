docker inspect --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' overlord

# Get the internal IP address of the overlord container 
# without starting its shell and
# in one command.

# -------------------------
# // note, this IP address is different from the IP address
# from docker-machine ip Char
# // returns 172.17.0.2
# because this is the internal ip address of the container, not the host !
