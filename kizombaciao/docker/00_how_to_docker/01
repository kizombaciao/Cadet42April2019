# Create a virtual machine with docker-machine 
# using the virtualbox driver, and named Char.

# TO START EXISTING MACHINE
# dm start Char

# Until recently Docker didn't run on native Mac or Windows OS, 
# so another tool was created, Docker-Machine, 
# which creates a virtual machine (using yet another tool, 
# e.g. Oracle VirtualBox), runs Docker on that VM, 
# and helps coordinate between the host OS and the Docker VM.

# Since Docker isn't running on your actual host OS, 
# docker-machine needs to deal 
# with IP addresses and ports and volumes and such. 
# And its settings are saved in environment variables, 
# which means you have to run commands 
# like this every time you open a new shell:
# > eval $(docker-machine env default)
# > docker-machine ip default
