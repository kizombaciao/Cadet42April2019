# From the shell of a debian container, 
# install via the containerâ€™s package manager everything 
# you need to compile C source code 
# and push it onto a git repo 
# (of course, make sure before that the package manager 
# and the packages already in the container are updated). 
# For this exercise, 
# you should only specify the commands to be run directly in the container.

# -------------------------
# run below commands first,
# docker pull debian
# docker run -it --rm debian

# // apt-get is a command-line tool 
# which helps in handling packages in Linux. 
# Its main task is to retrieve the information 
# and packages from the authenticated sources for installation, 
# upgrade and removal of packages along with their dependencies. 
# Here APT stands for the Advanced Packaging Tool.

# -y flag:
# Automatic yes to prompts; assume "yes" as answer to all prompts and
#   run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as
#   changing a held package, trying to install a unauthenticated
#   package or removing an essential package occurs then apt-get will
#   abort. Configuration Item: APT::Get::Assume-Yes.

# The build-essentials package is a reference 
# for all the packages needed to compile a Debian package. 
# It generally includes the GCC/g++ compilers
