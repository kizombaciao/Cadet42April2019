# Launch a 42school/engineering-bay service in two replicas 
# and make sure that the service works properly 
# (see the documentation provided at hub.docker.com). 
# This service will be named engineering-bay 
# and will be on the overmind network.

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43408493/what-is-the-difference-between-docker-service-and-docker-container
# In short: Docker service is used mostly 
# when you configured the master node with Docker swarm 
# so that docker containers will run in a distributed environment 
# and it can be easily managed.

# ???
# why is there no -p flag for ports ???
# why the prefix 'oc' ?
# because it's an environment variables explained in the docker hub page.

# why do i need '42school' ?
# https://hub.docker.com/r/42school/engineering-bay

# note, engineering-bay is service name, not container name !

# TO SCALE UP OR DOWN THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS:
# docker service scale engineering-bay=1

# TO REMOVE
# docker service rm engineering-bay

# note, a possible good practice
# use a '_vars' file, that 'declare' and 'export' env variables
# like how jraleman did
# and use 'source "_vars";' inside the docker script
