docker run -it --rm alpine

# Launch a shell from an alpine container, 
# and make sure that you can interact directly 
# with the container via your terminal, 
# and that the container deletes itself 
# once the shellâ€™s execution is done.

# -------------------------
# // note, the command takes you to the shell without the bin/bash
# type docker ps -a, to see that the container is not there.
# type docker images, to see that the alpine image is still there.
