# Launch a wordpress container as a background task, 
# just for fun. The container should be named lair, 
# its 80 port should be bound to the 8080 port of the virtual machine, 
# and it should be able to use the spawning-pool container 
# as a database service. 
# You can try to access lair on your machine via a web browser, 
# with the IP address of the virtual machine as a URL.
# Congratulations, you just deployed a functional Wordpress website 
# in two commands!

# via which Docker containers can communicate to each other.
# You might have a Web Server and a Database Server.
# A new tool Docker Compose is the recommended way moving forward.
